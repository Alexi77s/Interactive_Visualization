# Interactive_Visualization
Using D3 libray to create visuals for the microbes in human navels while reading the URL that was provided in the assignment. Javascript and html  were utilized to aid in creating bar chart and drop down menu of the different microbes that were found in the human navel. Also, a bubble chart was displayed with different sizes and colors of microbes. 

When my html went to live server, I noticed there were some issues because the visuals that we were suppose to have were not there so I have to check on my code and see what I did wrong but the headings did come out correctly.
